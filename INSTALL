INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

PATCH

If you are using RT 3.6.0 or earlier, you MUST apply a patch in order to use 
this extension. 

Patch(es) are in patch directory. Apply patch with following commands:

    cd /opt/rt3
    patch -p0 <path/to/patch/command_by_mail-<patch version>-RT-<rt version>.patch


Use the patch with the greatest <patch version> -- old patches are
shipped with the distribution so you can revert old patch(es) and apply
the new one on upgrades.

If you are using RT 3.6.1 or later, you no longer need to apply a patch.

CONFIGURE

Add 'Filter::TakeAction' to the list of mail plugins in RT_SiteConfig.pm.
(You'll need to add Auth::MailFrom to the list as well if you want to run the
test suite.  Auth::MailFrom is distributed with RT as
RT::Interface::Email::Auth::MailFrom.)

Restart web server.

Note that Filter::TakeAction should be pushed into list *after* Auth::MailFrom 
or any similar plugin that loads a current user object.

You can do this by adding the following line to your RT::SiteConfig:

@MailPlugins = qw(Auth::MailFrom Filter::TakeAction);

If you are running RT-3.8 you will need to use slightly different syntax

Set(@MailPlugins, qw(Auth::MailFrom Filter::TakeAction));

You will also need to add RT::Extension::CommandByMail to your
Plugins list.

Set(@Plugins,(qw(RT::Extension::CommandByMail)))

There is an optional configuration option CommandByMailGroup
Set($CommandByMailGroup, group_id);
You can find the id in 3.8 by browsing to Configuration -> Groups

Enjoy.
