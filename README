DESCRIPTION
    This extension allows you to manage tickets via email interface. You may
    put commands into the beginning of a mail, and extension will apply
    them. See the list of commands in the
    RT::Interface::Email::Filter::TakeAction docs.

    CAVEAT: commands are line oriented, so you can't expand to multiple
    lines for each command, i.e. values can't contains new lines. The module
    also currently expects and parses text, not HTML.

SECURITY
    This extension has no extended auth system; so all security issues that
    apply to the RT in general also apply to the extension.

INSTALLATION
    "perl Makefile.PL"
    "make"
    "make install"
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, ( @Plugins, "RT::Extension::CommandByMail" ));

        As well as:

            Set(@MailPlugins, qw(Auth::MailFrom Filter::TakeAction));

        If you already have a @MailPlugins configuration line, add
        "Filter::TakeAction" after any authentication plugins (such as
        "Auth::MailFrom" or "Auth::Crypt").

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
  $CommandByMailGroup
    You may set a $CommandByMailGroup to a particular group ID in
    RT_SiteConfig. If set, only members of this group may perform commands
    by mail.

  $CommandByMailHeader
    You may set this configuration value to the name of a header to examine
    as well. For example:

        Set($CommandByMailHeader, "X-RT-Command");

  $CommandByMailOnlyHeaders
    If set, the body will not be examined, only the headers.

COMMANDS
    This extension parses the body and headers of incoming messages for list
    commands. Format of commands is:

        Command: value
        Command: value
        ...

    See the list of commands in the RT::Interface::Email::Filter::TakeAction
    docs.

CAVEATS
    This extension is incompatible with "UnsafeEmailCommands" RT option.
